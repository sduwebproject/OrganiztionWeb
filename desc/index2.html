      <p class="aaa">Hello dear tourists! </p>
      <p class="aaa">Kolsai lakes - a system of three lakes in the northern Tien Shan, in the Kolsai gorge, in the
        bridge connecting the Kungei-Alatau and Zailiyskiy Alatau ridges. The lakes are located on the territory of the
        Raiymbek district of the Almaty region of Kazakhstan and are located 10 km north of the border with Kyrgyzstan,
        330 km south-east of Almaty at an altitude of about 1000 m, 2500 m, 2700 m above sea level. </p>
      <p>The purpose of the holiday is to promote tourism, highlight its contribution to the economy of the world
        community, and develop ties between peoples of different countries. It aims to draw the attention of the
        international community to the importance of tourism and its social, cultural and economic significance. </p>
      <p>You can get to Lake Kaindy from Almaty in about 5 hours by changing to an SUV in the village of Sati. By the
        way, from there the road leads to the Kolsai Lakes, another amazing corner of Kazakh nature, located just 12 km
        west of Lake Kaindy. You will not regret it if you dare to look there too. Kolsai lakes and Kaindy are part of
        the unified national natural park, formed in 2007. </p>
      <img class="right" src="assets/images/kayindy.jpg" width="250" height="200">

      <p>Almaty region is known for its picturesque places and one of them is the enchanting lake of incredible beauty -
        Kayindy. It belongs to the Kolsai Lakes system and is its brightest representative. The reservoir is surrounded
        by tall spruce trees, but its name means "teeming with birches", despite the fact that birch groves are located
        a few kilometers from Kayinda. The lake is located in a hollow hidden behind a dense forest, so it is almost
        impossible to see the water surface from above. But the most important feature of the lake is the "silent
        guards" - the trunks of ancient fir trees, turned by time, towering right in the middle of it. The most
        interesting thing is that the lower branches are surprisingly well preserved, hidden from the sun and wind by
        the cold mountain water. </p>
